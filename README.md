# css-pocket-guide
This CSS Pocket Guide project was created mainly for my educational purposes, to practice newly acquired CSS skills and due to lack of time it is far from perfect.  But you can use this code if you  find it useful. Please note the sources in footer of every page of my website. They was very helpful for me in creating my first more complex project.
